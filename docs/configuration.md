# Configuration

MetaQuest reads its run-time settings from command-line flags, environment variables and an optional
user config file. This page lists every setting, where each one can be given, and the order in which
the sources are consulted. The settings are defined in one table, `SETTINGS` in
`metaquest/core/settings.py`; the location of the shared data store is resolved separately, by
`metaquest/store/resolve.py`.

## The config file

The file is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/metaquest/config.toml`, or `~/.config/metaquest/config.toml` when
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set. It is optional. It has two tables:

```toml
[runtime]
timeout = 0                    # seconds before an external tool is stopped; 0 means no limit
min_free_gb = 50
progress_every = 100
log_host = true
ncbi_email = "you@example.org"

[store]
data_root = "/proj/group/metaquest-store"
```

`store_init --set-default` writes the `[store]` table and keeps every other table in the file.

A file that is not valid TOML, a `[runtime]` that is not a table, or a value that does not parse
stops every command with exit code 3 and a message naming the file and the key. `metaquest doctor` is
the exception: it still runs and reports the problem as a failed check. A key in `[runtime]` that
names no setting is reported as a warning and ignored. Other tables are ignored.

Values may be written as TOML numbers, booleans or strings (`timeout = 600` and `timeout = "600"` are
the same). An array or a table is not a valid value.

## Runtime settings

Each setting can be given in the `[runtime]` table under its config key, in its environment variable,
and, for most, with a flag. An empty environment variable counts as not set.

| Config key | Type | Default | Environment variable | Flag |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `timeout` | seconds, 0 or more | 0 (no limit) | `METAQUEST_TIMEOUT` | `--timeout` |
| `max_workers_cap` | whole number, 1 or more | 4 | `METAQUEST_MAX_WORKERS_CAP` | none |
| `lock_wait` | seconds, 0 or more | 0 (no limit) | `METAQUEST_LOCK_WAIT` | `--lock-wait` |
| `registry_lock_wait` | seconds, more than 0 | 30 | `METAQUEST_REGISTRY_LOCK_WAIT` | none |
| `registry_lock_stale` | seconds, more than 0 | 120 | `METAQUEST_REGISTRY_LOCK_STALE` | none |
| `dataset_lock_stale` | seconds, more than 0 | 600 | `METAQUEST_DATASET_LOCK_STALE` | none |
| `lock_heartbeat` | seconds, more than 0 | 10 | `METAQUEST_LOCK_HEARTBEAT` | none |
| `catalog_lock_wait` | seconds, more than 0 | 60 | `METAQUEST_CATALOG_LOCK_WAIT` | none |
| `ncbi_email` | email address | none | `METAQUEST_NCBI_EMAIL` | `--email` |
| `ncbi_api_key` | text | none | `METAQUEST_NCBI_API_KEY`, then `NCBI_API_KEY` | `--api-key` |
| `temp_folder` | path (`~` expanded) | none | `METAQUEST_TEMP_FOLDER` | `--temp-folder` |
| `log_file` | path (`~` expanded) | none | `METAQUEST_LOG_FILE` | `--log-file` |
| `log_level` | level name | INFO | `METAQUEST_LOG_LEVEL` | `--log-level`, `-q`, `-v` |
| `progress_every` | whole number, 0 or more | 50 | `METAQUEST_PROGRESS_EVERY` | `--progress-every` |
| `log_host` | true or false | false | `METAQUEST_LOG_HOST` | none |
| `min_free_gb` | number, 0 or more | 10 | `METAQUEST_MIN_FREE_GB` | `--min-free-gb` |
| `prefetch_max_size` | whole number with optional K, M, G or T suffix | 100G | `METAQUEST_PREFETCH_MAX_SIZE` | none |
| `assembly_memory` | `auto`, a fraction, or a size | auto | `METAQUEST_ASSEMBLY_MEMORY` | `--assembly-memory` |
| `run_log` | true or false | true | `METAQUEST_RUN_LOG` | none |

The flags exist on these commands:

- `--timeout`, `--temp-folder`: `download_sra` and `extract_target_reads`.
- `--lock-wait`: `download_sra` and `store_adopt`.
- `--email`, `--api-key`: `download_metadata`, `sra_info` and `validate_taxonomy`.
- `--min-free-gb`: `download_sra`. `--assembly-memory`: `extract_target_reads`.
- `--log-file`, `--log-level`, `-q`, `-v`, `--progress-every`: every command, before or after the command
  name.

A level name is DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR or CRITICAL, in any case. A true or false value may also be
written yes/no, on/off or 1/0.

What each setting does:

- `timeout`: how long `prefetch`, `fasterq-dump`, minimap2, samtools or megahit may run before it is
  stopped. A stopped download is classified as a network failure and retried. A `--version` probe
  always uses a fixed 30 s limit.
- `max_workers_cap`: the upper bound on the default number of parallel downloads, which is the CPUs
  available to the job divided by `--num-threads` (never more than 10, whatever the cap). An explicit
  `--max-workers` is used as given.
- `lock_wait`: how long `download_sra` and `store_adopt` wait for another run's lock on the same
  accession before giving up on that accession.
- `registry_lock_wait`, `registry_lock_stale`: how long a command waits for the project registry lock,
  and how long a registry lock may go without a heartbeat before it is taken over. `registry_lock_stale`
  must be more than the registry heartbeat of 5 s.
- `dataset_lock_stale`, `lock_heartbeat`: the same two limits for the store dataset locks, the
  per-accession download locks of a plain project, and the index-build and extraction locks.
  `lock_heartbeat` must be less than `dataset_lock_stale`.
- `catalog_lock_wait`: how long a store catalogue write waits for the catalogue lock.
- `ncbi_email`, `ncbi_api_key`: sent with NCBI requests. A command that talks to NCBI stops with exit
  code 3 when no email address is set by any of the three routes. The key is never written to a log;
  it is shown as `(set)`.
- `temp_folder`: where `fasterq-dump` writes its temporary files, and where `extract_target_reads`
  writes its intermediate alignments. When it is not set, `download_sra` gives each accession a scratch
  folder of its own beside the download: `fastq/.metaquest-tmp/<accession>_fqtmp` in a project without a
  store, `<data-root>/tmp/<accession>_fqtmp` with one. Set it to a local disk when the project or store
  is on a network filesystem and the node has local scratch space.
- `log_file`, `log_level`, `progress_every`, `log_host`: see "Logging" in the README.
  `progress_every` 0 turns the progress summaries off and logs one INFO line per item instead.
- `min_free_gb`: the free space a download of unknown size needs on each filesystem it writes to;
  0 turns the free-space check off. See "Downloading reads" in the README.
- `prefetch_max_size`: the value passed to `prefetch --max-size`; a run whose `.sra` archive is larger is
  not fetched. A whole number of bytes, or a whole number with a K, M, G or T suffix (in either case).
- `assembly_memory`: the value passed to megahit `--memory`. `auto` gives 90% of the memory limit detected
  for the job (cgroup v2, cgroup v1, else `SLURM_MEM_PER_NODE` or `SLURM_MEM_PER_CPU`) and leaves
  megahit's own default when no limit is found. A size such as `32G` or `32000M` (binary units) or a whole
  number of bytes (at least 1M) is passed in bytes. A fraction such as `0.5` is passed as it is; megahit
  applies it to the whole node's memory, so under a scheduler give a size or `auto` instead.
- `run_log`: whether a command that keeps a run log adds a record of each run to
  `<project>/.metaquest/runs/` (see "Project state" in the README). Nothing is written in a folder
  without a project registry, and a run log that cannot be written is reported as a warning without
  changing the command's exit code. false turns the run log off.

## Order of precedence

A runtime setting is taken from the first of these that gives a value:

1. the flag, when the command has one and it was given;
2. the environment variable (`METAQUEST_<NAME>`; for the API key, `METAQUEST_NCBI_API_KEY` and then
   `NCBI_API_KEY`);
3. the `[runtime]` table of the config file;
4. the built-in default.

The root of the shared data store is taken from the first of these that names one:

1. `--data-root`;
2. the `METAQUEST_DATA` environment variable;
3. `store.root` in the project registry (`metaquest_registry.json`);
4. `data_root` in the `[store]` table of the config file.

A root found this way must hold the store marker (`metaquest_store.json`), or the command stops with a
message naming the rule that produced the root. When none of the four names a root, the project works
without a store.

The two orders differ because the two kinds of value differ. A runtime setting tunes one run, and a
project has no record of its own for it, so the per-user config file is the last place before the
default. The store root describes where a project's data are, and a project that has joined a store
records that store in its registry; the registry therefore comes before the per-user config file, so
every command run in the project finds the store the project uses even when the user's default store is
a different one. The flag and `METAQUEST_DATA` still come first, so a store that has been moved or is
mounted at another path can be named without editing the registry.

## Seeing the values in use

`metaquest doctor` lists every runtime setting with its value and the source it came from (a flag, a
variable, `config [runtime] <key>`, or `default`), with the API key shown as `(set)`, and the store
root it resolved; the rule that produced the root is logged at INFO (`Resolved store root from
METAQUEST_DATA: ...`). A command run at DEBUG (`-v` or `--log-level DEBUG`) logs the same list
at its start:

```
Runtime settings (value and source):
  subprocess_timeout = 0.0 (default)
  max_workers_cap = 4 (default)
  lock_wait = 3600.0 (--lock-wait)
  ...
  min_free_gb = 50.0 (config [runtime] min_free_gb)
```

The names in this list are the setting names of `SETTINGS`; they equal the config keys except for
`subprocess_timeout`, whose config key is `timeout`.

## Adding a setting

A new setting is one entry in `_SPECS` in `metaquest/core/settings.py` (name, parser, default,
environment variable, description, and the flag's `dest` when a command has one) and one field in
`RuntimeSettings`. Code reads it with `settings.active().<name>`, or with `setting_for(args, name)`
inside a command so a flag in a hand-built namespace is still honoured. This page and the table above
list every entry of `SETTINGS`.
