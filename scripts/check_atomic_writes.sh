#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Fail on a direct, non-atomic file write under metaquest/.
#
# Every output file and every shared state file is written through the helpers in
# metaquest/data/file_io.py (write_text_atomic, write_bytes_atomic, write_csv, open_atomic,
# atomic_path): the content goes to a unique temporary name next to the target and is moved into
# place with one rename, so a reader, a second process or an interrupted run never sees a partial
# file. This gate flags the direct forms that bypass them:
#   .write_text(   .write_bytes(   .to_csv(<path> ...)   open(<path>, "w..." / 'w...')
# A to_csv call without a path (to_csv(), to_csv(sep=...)) returns a string and is allowed, as are
# read and append modes. Comment lines are ignored. A module that must write directly (the helpers
# themselves, an append-only log) is listed in scripts/atomic_writes_allowlist.txt, one path per
# line followed by the reason; an entry whose file no longer exists, or that has no reason, fails
# the gate so the list only shrinks with the code.
# Limitation: plain grep, one line at a time, so an open( call split across lines is not seen.
# Usage: scripts/check_atomic_writes.sh [ROOT]   (ROOT defaults to the repository root)
