# Fail on any non-ASCII byte in the project's tracked Python, script and config source.
#
# ASCII-only keeps terminal output, diffs and grep-based tooling (including the other gates in
# this directory) predictable regardless of locale. A line may still hold non-ASCII bytes when
# that content is meaningful rather than incidental and the line carries the marker "# ascii-ok"
# with a reason: the maintainer's name in pyproject.toml, and deliberate test fixtures (full-width
# and superscript homoglyphs, non-Latin category labels) that exercise input sanitisation and
# Unicode-safe serialisation. The marker covers only its own line, so the rest of the file is
# still checked.
# Usage: scripts/check_ascii.sh [ROOT]   (ROOT defaults to the repository root)

# A bracket expression excluding printable ASCII (space through tilde) and tab, matched byte by
# byte (LC_ALL=C). Deliberately not `grep -P '[^\x00-\x7F]'`: plain BSD grep, which this runs
# under on a stock macOS install and in most CI images, has no -P/PCRE support. The $'...' form
# is required so the tab in the bracket expression is a real tab byte, not the two characters
# backslash-t (which BSD grep does not expand inside a bracket expression, and which would then
# flag every tab-indented Makefile recipe line as non-ASCII).

# The files to check: the tracked ones inside a git checkout, or every matching file on disk
# when the root is not a checkout (a `git archive` export, an unpacked sdist), so the gate
# never passes by checking nothing.
