"""Check that README.md documents exactly the CLI commands the registry exposes.

Every command name visible in ``metaquest --help`` (that is, every registered command whose
``hidden`` property is false; the pre-0.5.0 renamed pointers in ``metaquest.cli.commands.renamed``
are ``hidden`` and excluded) must be mentioned somewhere in README.md. Conversely, every literal
``metaquest <word>`` invocation shown in README.md must name a command the registry knows about.
A renamed command's old name is allowed to appear as an invocation only inside the "Renamed ...
commands" section that documents the rename; anywhere else it is treated as unknown, the same as
a typo would be.

Usage: python scripts/check_docs_commands.py
Exit status is 1, with the diff printed, when README.md is missing a command or names an unknown
one; 0 when it matches the registry.
