# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MetaQuest is a command-line bioinformatics toolkit for analyzing metagenomic datasets based on genome containment. The software processes Branchwater CSV files, downloads SRA metadata from NCBI, and provides advanced visualization capabilities for containment analysis, including intelligent SRA management with resume capability and comprehensive quality profiling.

## Development Commands

### Quick Start
- `make dev-install` - Install with development dependencies
- `make help` - Show all available commands

### Testing and Quality
- `make test` - Run pytest with coverage (currently 88%+ overall coverage)
- `make lint` - Run flake8 linting (currently passing)
- `make format` - Format code with black
- `make check` - Full quality check (format, lint, type check)
- `make pipeline` - Run full test pipeline via local_test.sh

### Build and Clean
- `make build` - Build distribution packages (uses pyproject.toml)
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts, cache files, and test data

### Installation
- `make install` - Install package for development
- `make dev-install` - Install with development dependencies
- Legacy: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (still supported)

## Architecture

MetaQuest follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components
- **CLI Layer** (`metaquest/cli/`): Command-line interface with modular command architecture using a registry pattern
- **Core Logic** (`metaquest/core/`): Domain models, validation, exceptions, and constants
- **Data Layer** (`metaquest/data/`): File I/O, Branchwater processing, metadata handling, basic SRA operations
- **Advanced SRA Package** (`metaquest/sra/`): Intelligent download management, quality profiling, interactive reporting
- **Processing** (`metaquest/processing/`): Containment analysis, statistical processing, counting algorithms
- **Plugins** (`metaquest/plugins/`): Extensible plugin system for formats and visualizers
- **Visualization** (`metaquest/visualization/`): Plotting and reporting functionality

### Key Design Patterns
- **Command Registry**: All CLI commands inherit from base classes and register themselves via `command_registry`
- **Plugin System**: Uses `PluginRegistry` with automatic discovery for format handlers and visualizers
- **Data Models**: Dataclasses in `core/models.py` define `Containment`, `SRAMetadata`, `GenomeInfo`, and `ContainmentSummary`
- **Dual SRA Architecture**: Basic operations in data layer, advanced features in specialized SRA package

## Project Structure

### Modern Python Packaging
- Uses `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging (PEP 518/621)
- Maintains `setup.py` for backward compatibility
- Configuration files: `setup.cfg` (flake8), `pyproject.toml` (build, black, mypy, pytest)

### Documentation Structure
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development guidelines
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed architecture documentation
- `docs/` - Additional documentation (workflow guides, etc.)
- `CLAUDE.md` - This file for Claude Code guidance

## Important Implementation Notes

### CLI Command Structure
New commands should:
1. Inherit from the appropriate base command class in `cli/base.py`
2. Register themselves in `cli/main.py` via the `register_all_commands()` function
3. Follow the existing pattern for argument parsing and execution
4. **CRITICAL**: Use dashes in CLI arguments (e.g., `--matches-folder`), not underscores

### Advanced SRA Commands
The intelligent SRA package provides four main CLI commands:
- `sra-download-intelligent` - Downloads with resume capability and bandwidth optimization
- `sra-profile-quality` - Comprehensive quality analysis of downloaded datasets
- `sra-dashboard` - Interactive HTML dashboard generation
- `sra-compare` - Statistical comparison between dataset groups

### Plugin Development
- Format plugins inherit from base Plugin class in `plugins/base.py`
- Register with `format_registry` for file format handlers
- Register with `visualizer_registry` for visualization types
- Implement required methods like `validate_header`, `parse_file`, `extract_metadata`

### Data Processing Pipeline
The typical workflow involves:
1. Processing Branchwater CSV files (`use_branchwater`)
2. Extracting/downloading metadata (`extract_branchwater_metadata` or `download_metadata`)
3. Parsing containment data (`parse_containment`) 
4. Visualization and analysis (`plot_containment`, `count_metadata`)
5. Advanced SRA operations (`sra-download-intelligent`, `sra-profile-quality`, `sra-dashboard`)

- **Edge Cases**: Empty datasets, malformed inputs, boundary conditions
- **Integration**: Test complete workflows with realistic data

#### Test Structure
```python
# Example test pattern for CLI commands
@pytest.fixture
def mock_file_operations():
    with patch('metaquest.data.file_io.read_file') as mock:
        yield mock

def test_command_execution(mock_file_operations):
    # Setup mocks
    # Execute command
    # Verify behavior
```

#### Coverage Requirements
- **New Code**: 80% minimum coverage
- **Bug Fixes**: Must include tests for the fixed scenario
- **Critical Paths**: CLI commands, data processing must have high coverage

### Integration Testing

The project includes comprehensive integration testing:
1. `local_test.sh` - Basic end-to-end CLI testing with sample data
2. `tests/test_integration_simple.py` - 12 integration tests covering:
   - SRA metadata workflows (retrieval → CSV export → visualization)
   - FASTQ processing pipelines (statistics → reports → visualization)
   - Multi-sample comparison workflows
   - Data export to multiple formats
   - Error handling in complete workflows

### Quality Gates
Before committing code:
1. `make check` must pass (linting, formatting, type checking)
2. `make test` must pass with coverage improvement
3. `make pipeline` integration test must pass
4. No decrease in overall coverage percentage

### Detailed Test Coverage Documentation
For comprehensive test coverage metrics, methodology, and detailed module-by-module results, see:
- `FINAL_TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md` - Complete test coverage report with 199 new tests
- `TEST_SESSION_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` - Session summary with best practices and benchmarks

## Legacy Code

Note: The codebase contains some legacy files that are still in use:
- `metaquest/cli/commands_legacy.py` - Legacy command implementations (still imported by current commands)

These files should not be removed as they contain functionality still used by the current command system.

## Development Workflow & Implementation Priorities

### Recommended Development Approach

When working on MetaQuest, follow this priority order:

#### 1. Maintenance Tasks (Ongoing Priority)
- **Maintain quality standards**: Run `make format` and ensure `make check` passes
- **No new code without tests**: Continue established testing practices
- **Architecture consistency**: Follow established patterns for new features

#### 2. Current Focus Areas (Optional Enhancement)
- **Remaining visualization modules**: interactive.py, reporting.py, plots.py (currently 0%)
- **Processing enhancements**: containment.py optimizations, diversity.py extensions
- **Plugin system expansion**: Additional format handler testing
- **Documentation**: Add testing guides and workflow documentation

#### 3. Code Quality Improvements (Medium Priority)
- **Add type hints**: Complete type annotation for remaining modules
- **Documentation enhancement**: Add docstrings for complex functions
- **Performance optimization**: Large dataset handling and memory efficiency

#### 4. Feature Enhancements (Lower Priority)
- **Only after maintaining current quality levels**
- **Must include comprehensive tests**
- **Should follow existing architectural patterns**

### Implementation Guidelines for Claude

#### When Adding New Features
1. **Check existing patterns**: Look at similar implementations first
2. **Write tests first**: TDD approach preferred for new features  
3. **Mock dependencies**: Don't rely on external systems in tests
4. **Follow plugin patterns**: Use existing registries for extensibility

#### When Fixing Bugs
1. **Write a test that reproduces the bug**: This should fail initially
2. **Fix the bug**: Minimal change approach
3. **Verify the test passes**: And doesn't break existing tests
4. **Check edge cases**: Consider similar scenarios

#### When Refactoring
1. **Ensure full test coverage first**: Don't refactor untested code
2. **Small incremental changes**: One logical change at a time
3. **Maintain backward compatibility**: Especially for CLI interfaces
4. **Update documentation**: If public interfaces change
