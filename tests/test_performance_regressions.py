"""Performance regression tests with time and memory bounds.

Every test here guards one of the performance fixes made across this project (registry batching
and serialisation, the FASTQ sampler, the containment summary and screening step, metadata XML
parsing, and the status/results report builders); each replaces a slower implementation that a
docstring below describes. Bounds are built the same way throughout: run the fixed code, take the
best of several timed runs on the development machine (Apple silicon laptop, macOS, 2026-09-26)
under ``make test``'s coverage instrumentation, and set the bound to about three times that
measurement, so normal machine and coverage variance does not make the test flaky while an actual
regression (an accidentally reintroduced quadratic pass, for example) still fails it. A failing
test reports the measured time in its assertion message, so a slower machine can be told apart
from a real regression by comparing that figure with the one in the docstring.

Fixtures live in ``tests/perf_fixtures.py``: a synthetic 20,000-dataset project registry built
through the real ``record_*`` writers, a 100,000-record gzip FASTQ file, 300 synthetic NCBI efetch
metadata XML files, and a 20,000 x 5 containment table.

Every time bound (not the memory bound) is multiplied by the ``METAQUEST_PERF_SCALE`` environment
variable (default 1, at least 1; CI sets 4 for its shared runners), and each failure message prints the
scale in effect.

Run only these tests with ``python -m pytest -m perf`` (``make test-perf``).
