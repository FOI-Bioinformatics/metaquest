"""``metaquest/core/constants.py``: nothing in the tree still names the constants removed from it.

``DEFAULT_MEMORY_LIMIT_GB``, ``MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB``, ``DEFAULT_PLUGIN_TIMEOUT``, ``ERROR_MESSAGES``
and ``SUCCESS_MESSAGES`` were never read anywhere outside their own definitions, and
``DEFAULT_MAX_WORKERS`` stopped being read when the worker count moved to the CPU detection; this guards
