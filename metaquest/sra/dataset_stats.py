"""The FASTQ files of one accession and its shared statistics record.

``sra_profile`` and ``sra_report`` both profile a dataset from the same two inputs: every mate
file of the accession, and the statistics record ``metaquest.store.stats.compute_dataset_stats``
computes over them (exact read and base totals, GC). The record is cached in the store sidecar
when the accession is a link into the shared store, so a dataset is read in full once.
