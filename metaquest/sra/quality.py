"""Per-read quality figures from a sample of a dataset's FASTQ files.

``SequenceQualityAnalyzer.analyze_fastq_quality`` samples reads from every mate file of a
dataset (uniformly over the whole of each file by default, with
``metaquest.data.sra.sample_records``) and returns their length, GC (in percent), base
quality, N content, complexity, duplication and adapter figures. Base qualities are kept as a
histogram of Phred scores rather than a per-base list. The dataset totals come from the
shared statistics record instead; see
