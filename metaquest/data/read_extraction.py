"""Targeted read extraction prior to assembly.

Given a parsed containment table (samples x target genomes), this module maps
each sample's reads against a chosen target genome and keeps only the reads that
align. The resulting reduced FASTQ set supports a small, targeted assembly rather
than a whole-metagenome assembly.

The mapping uses minimap2 (one aligner for both short and long reads) and samtools
to filter and export the mapped reads. External tools run through
``SecureSubprocess.run_secure`` and must be present on the system.

        genome_fasta: FASTA file for the target genome.
        fastq_folder: Root folder with per-accession FASTQ subdirectories.
        output_folder: Root folder for the extracted reads (per-accession subdirs).
        threshold: Minimum containment for a sample to be included.
        preset: minimap2 preset (sr, map-ont, map-pb, map-hifi).

        dry_run: If True, report the qualifying samples without running any tool.

        on_result: Called on the main thread with (accession, result) after every sample of a

            lands. A callback that raises is logged and does not stop the run. Dry runs never

            addition to dropping secondary/supplementary alignments. 0 keeps every mapped
            record regardless of quality; a divergent strain of the target genome can map with
            a genuinely low MAPQ, so a nonzero value is best reserved for close relatives.

            sample's own output folder when not given.
        allow_truncated: If True, extract even for a sample whose registry download verdict is
            "truncated" (via ``truncated_downloads``); otherwise that sample is skipped.
        mate_counts: Accession -> (mate 1 reads, mate 2 reads). When the two counts differ,
            the sample's mate files are mapped independently as single-end reads rather than
            as a pair, deliberately rather than relying on minimap2's own stderr warning.
        truncated_downloads: Accession -> the registry's download completeness verdict, for
            samples whose verdict is "truncated". Such a sample is skipped unless
            ``allow_truncated``.
        keep_sam: If True, keep the intermediate SAM alignment(s) instead of removing them

            without them (e.g. ExFAT) fails; pointing this at a POSIX filesystem works

    Returns:
