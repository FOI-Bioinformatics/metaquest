"""Staging for one sample's extracted FASTQ files, so an interrupted sample leaves nothing visible.

``samtools fastq`` writes a sample's mapped reads into a dot-prefixed folder inside the
sample's output folder (``targeted/<ACC>/.<genome>.<host>.<pid>.<token>.tmp/``). Only once the
sample is complete are the files renamed into ``targeted/<ACC>/``, one rename per file. Every
folder listing (``visible_files``, and so ``scan_extractions`` and ``status --reconcile``)
skips dot-prefixed names, so a sample stopped by a signal, a timeout or a kill never leaves a
partial FASTQ that a later scan could record as a finished extraction. A hidden
``.<genome>.extracted.json`` beside the files records the names each genome's last run
published, so a rerun removes only its own earlier files (see ``publish_staged``).

``require_nonempty`` guards a staged output a tool reported as written (the minimap2 index)
against being published empty.
