"""Locks that keep two processes from building the same minimap2 index, or extracting the
same sample, at once.

Both reuse ``metaquest.utils.lockfile.held_lock``. The index build lock is blocking: a
second process that asks for the same index while the first is still building it waits,
then reuses what the first one built rather than building it again. The per-sample lock is
not: when it is already held, the caller (``read_extraction.extract_target_reads``) treats
that sample as being worked on elsewhere -- typically an overlapping SLURM shard that
selected the same sample independently -- and reports it skipped rather than waiting or
mapping it twice.
