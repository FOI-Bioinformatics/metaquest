The registry records decisions and provenance for every SRA accession a
project touches: screening results per target genome, the selection criteria,
exclusions with reasons, download outcomes with file sizes and dates, analyses,

taken from the registry alone; ``status`` re-checks the filesystem and the
scanners here rebuild or reconcile the journal from what is on disk.
