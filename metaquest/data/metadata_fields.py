"""Mapping from parsed NCBI metadata XML fields to the registry's metadata block fields.

Moved out of ``cli.commands.metadata`` so a registry can be filled in from an already-downloaded
metadata XML folder (``fill_metadata_from_xml``) without going through the CLI layer. The CLI
commands import ``FIELD_COLUMNS`` and ``metadata_fields`` from here so both still agree on one
column-to-field mapping.
