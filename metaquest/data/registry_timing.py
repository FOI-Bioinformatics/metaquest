"""How long downloads, extractions and assemblies took, recorded in the project registry.

Each of the download, extraction and assembly blocks carries two optional keys: ``started``, when
the step began (ISO 8601 UTC, to the second), and ``seconds``, the wall-clock time it took. Both
are left out of a block that has no timing, so a registry written before these keys existed is
rewritten unchanged. The setters here are called by the commands right after the step's own
``record_*`` call; passing None for both values removes the keys, so a step that did not run (a
dataset linked from the shared store, for example) does not keep the time of an earlier one.

``timing_summary`` gives the counts, totals and medians ``status`` reports.
