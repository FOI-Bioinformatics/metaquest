"""
The per-project run log: one record per run of a command that keeps one.

Layout, under ``<project>/.metaquest/runs/`` (the project is the folder holding the registry file):

- ``runs.jsonl``: one JSON object per line, one line per run, in the order the runs finished. Lines
  are appended under ``runs.jsonl.lock``; a line cut short by an interrupted append is skipped on
  reading, with one warning.
- ``<run_id>.json``: the detail of one run (larger tables a command passes through ``note_run``),
  written atomically. Only the last ``DETAILS_KEPT_PER_COMMAND`` detail files of each command are
  kept; a pruned run keeps its line in ``runs.jsonl`` with ``"detail": null`` (and any key a later
  schema added to the line). A detail file written for an append that then failed names no line
  and so is never pruned; it is left in the folder.

``main`` records a run after the command returns, when the command's ``records_run`` is true, the
``run_log`` setting is on and a registry file exists; a failure to record is logged as a warning and
never changes the command's exit code. The registry itself holds no list of runs.
