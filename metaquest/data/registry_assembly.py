"""What an assembly was built from, and whether a recorded assembly still matches its reads.

An assembly block may carry an optional ``inputs`` key describing the extracted reads and
settings it was built from. It is left out while unset, so a registry written before the key
existed is rewritten unchanged. ``record_extraction`` drops a recorded assembly, because a new
extraction replaces the reads the assembly was built from.

For an assembly recorded without ``inputs`` (one made by an earlier version), two checks give a
conservative view of whether it is stale: ``assembly_predates_extraction`` compares the two
recorded dates, and ``legacy_assembly_current`` also compares the recorded megahit preset and
minimum contig length with the requested ones.
