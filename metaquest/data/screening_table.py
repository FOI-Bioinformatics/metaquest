"""Screening entries recorded from a parsed containment table in one pass.

``parse_containment`` writes a wide table (one row per accession, one column per genome) and
records every positive cell as a screening entry in the project registry. Recording the cells one
at a time rebuilt an accession's screening block once per genome and stamped each cell with its
own time; capping afterwards rebuilt every block once per genome again. Here the positive cells
are found with numpy, the per-genome cap is applied before anything is written, and each
accession's block is converted and written once, with one timestamp for the whole run. The result
equals recording the cells one by one and then calling ``cap_screening`` for each genome.

It lives next to ``metaquest.data.registry``, which is held at its current size by the module
size ceiling; ``registry.record_screening_from_table`` delegates here.
