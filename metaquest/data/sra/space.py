"""Free-space guard for downloads: start an accession only when the disk has room for it.

A download writes to three places: the FASTQ output folder (a project's ``fastq/`` or the
store's ``tmp/``, where the uncompressed files are built before gzip), ``fasterq-dump``'s
temporary folder, and, with ``prefetch``, the ``.sra`` cache. Before each accession starts, the
guard estimates what it needs on each filesystem and checks it against the free space left
once the downloads already running are counted, so parallel workers cannot each see the same
free space and together fill the disk. An accession that would fit once the downloads in
progress release their reservations waits for them; one that would not fit even then is refused
on its own (``insufficient-space: ...``) and the rest of the run goes on.

The estimate for an accession with a known run size (NCBI's ``.sra`` size, from the project
registry) is ``FASTQ_EXPANSION`` plus ``GZIP_EXPANSION`` times that size for the output folder
(compression writes each ``.gz`` before it removes the uncompressed file, so both are there
together), ``FASTQ_EXPANSION`` times for the temporary folder (an assumption: equal to the
output, not measured), plus the ``.sra`` size for the cache when ``prefetch`` is used. Needs of
locations that share a filesystem are added. An accession without a known size needs
``floor_bytes`` (``--min-free-gb``) on each filesystem instead. A filesystem whose free space
cannot be read is assumed to have room, as ``store_adopt`` does: refusing on an unreadable
``disk_usage`` would be worse than trying.

The free space ``disk_usage`` reports already falls as running downloads write, while their full
reservations are still subtracted, so a download in progress is partly counted twice; the guard
errs toward starting the next accession a little later.
