        max_retries: Maximum number of retry attempts for failed downloads
        temp_folder: Directory to use for fasterq-dump temporary files

        blacklist_accessions: An additional set of accessions to skip (e.g. registry exclusions),
            joined with any accessions read from ``blacklist``
        on_result: Optional callback invoked with (accession, success, message) on the main
            thread as each download (and each retry) completes
        expected_spots: Per-accession NCBI ``run_total_spots``, used to verify each download's
            completeness once it finishes; an accession missing from this mapping is reported
            as "unverified" rather than "complete"/"truncated"
        redownload_truncated: Forwarded to every ``download_accession`` call so a partial copy
            left on disk by a prior truncated attempt is wiped and redownloaded rather than
            reused
        truncated_accessions: Accessions whose registry verdict is "truncated"; excluded from
            ``already_downloaded`` so they are redownloaded even though files exist on disk
        sra_cache: Forwarded to every ``download_accession`` call; directory prefetch downloads
            the ``.sra`` archive into (defaults to ``<fastq_folder>/.sra-cache`` per accession)
        use_prefetch: Forwarded to every ``download_accession`` call; download via prefetch then
            fasterq-dump when True and prefetch is on PATH, else fasterq-dump directly
        keep_sra: Forwarded to every ``download_accession`` call; keep the ``.sra`` archive
            after a successful, verified download instead of deleting it
        compress: Forwarded to every ``download_accession`` call; gzip each downloaded FASTQ
            file once its completeness verdict has been computed
        store: Layout of a shared data store. When given, every dataset is downloaded once
            into ``<store>/sra/<ACC>`` and this project's ``fastq/<ACC>`` becomes a link to
            it; a dataset another project already downloaded is linked without any network
            call
        link_mode: How the project points at the store: ``auto``, ``relative``, ``absolute``
            or ``copy`` (see ``metaquest.store.link.link_dataset``)
        accept_partial: Link a store copy whose download is incomplete instead of refusing
            it; only consulted when ``resume_partial`` is off
        resume_partial: Download an incomplete store copy again rather than refusing to use
            it
        store_metadata: One folder, or an ordered list of folders, searched for
            ``<ACC>_metadata.xml`` to record NCBI's spot count in the dataset's sidecar; the
            store's own metadata folder is always tried last
        lock_wait: Seconds to wait for another run's lock on an accession (the store's dataset
            lock, or without a store the project's ``<fastq>/.locks/<ACC>.lock``) before giving
            up on that accession; zero (the default) waits for as long as the other run keeps
            working, since a download legitimately takes hours
        stop: This run's stop token; a new one is made when None. It reaches every worker,
            ``download_accession`` and each prefetch, fasterq-dump or pigz child. Setting it
            prevents this run from starting further tools and ends its lock waits, but a tool
            already running keeps going until it ends; ``SecureSubprocess.terminate_children(
            stop=stop)`` also stops those. Either way only this run is affected; another run in
            the same process keeps going. The process-wide ``accession.STOP`` still stops every
            run from starting further tools
        run_sizes: Per-accession ``.sra`` size in bytes (NCBI's run size, from the registry),
            used by the free-space guard to estimate what each download needs
        min_free_gb: Free space, in GB, an accession without a known run size needs on every
            filesystem a download writes to; 0 turns the free-space guard off; None uses the
            ``min_free_gb`` setting (``--min-free-gb``, ``METAQUEST_MIN_FREE_GB``, default 10)
        timings: When given, receives ``accession -> (started, seconds)`` for every download
            attempt that ran, filled before that attempt's ``on_result`` call
