    """Download ``accession`` into a project without a shared store, one process at a time.

    The worker ``download_sra`` uses when no store is configured; it takes
    ``download_accession``'s arguments. The per-accession lock ``<fastq>/.locks/<ACC>.lock``
    (the dataset lock's policy: heartbeat, stale takeover, no overall timeout unless
    ``lock_wait`` is positive) is held for the whole download. Inside it the folder is checked
    again, since another process may have finished the accession while this one waited, and
    an accession found complete is reported as "already exists". Otherwise the download is
    built under ``<fastq>/.metaquest-tmp`` and published with one rename, so a second process
    never sees a half-moved or half-compressed folder; an existing folder is replaced only
    once its replacement is complete. The check is skipped for a forced download and for an
    accession in ``truncated`` (the registry's truncated verdicts); without that set,
    ``redownload_truncated`` skips it for every accession, as ``download_accession`` does.

    The prefetch cache defaults to ``<fastq>/.sra-cache`` as before. A ``sra_cache`` folder
    the caller supplies and shares with another project is not covered by this lock (only a
    shared store locks across projects). ``stop`` is the run's stop token: when it (or the
    process-wide ``STOP``) is set, a wait for the lock ends with the result
    ``(False, "interrupted")``; it is passed on to ``download_accession``.
