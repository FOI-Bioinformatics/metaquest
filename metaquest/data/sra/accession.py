    (the dataset lock's policy: heartbeat, stale takeover, no overall timeout unless
    ``lock_wait`` is positive) is held for the whole download. Inside it the folder is checked
    again, since another process may have finished the accession while this one waited, and
    an accession found complete is reported as "already exists". Otherwise the download is
    built under ``<fastq>/.metaquest-tmp`` and published with one rename, so a second process

    ``redownload_truncated`` skips it for every accession, as ``download_accession`` does.

    Without ``temp_folder``, fasterq-dump's scratch is ``project_scratch_path`` (under the
    staging folder), wiped under the lock before the download and again once it ends.

    the caller supplies and shares with another project is not covered by this lock (only a
    shared store locks across projects). ``stop`` is the run's stop token: when it (or the
