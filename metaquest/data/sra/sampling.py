"""
Index-based sampling of FASTQ records, and per-base quality scores kept as histograms.

``sample_records`` is the one sampler behind the quality profile
(``metaquest.sra.quality.SequenceQualityAnalyzer``) and the store statistics record
(``metaquest.store.stats.compute_dataset_stats``). It draws the record indices to keep up
front, from the dataset's record count, and then streams the files once in large binary
blocks, locating records by counting newlines and slicing out only the selected ones. No
per-record Python work is done for the records that are skipped, which is what made the
earlier reservoir sampler slow on a large run.

The sampler assumes the four-line FASTQ layout that ``fasterq-dump`` and ``count_fastq_reads``
assume: header, sequence, ``+`` separator and quality, each on exactly one line.
