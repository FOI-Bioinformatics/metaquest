    """Run the parallel downloads and optional retry pass.

    ``stop`` is the run's stop token (a new one when None), shared by both passes. The worker
    (``downloader``, or ``download_accession``) is wrapped once by ``_instrumented`` and both
    passes call the wrapped one: ``guard`` (a ``SpaceGuard``, or None for no free-space check)
    is asked for room before every attempt, and ``timings`` (when given) receives each
    accession's start time and duration.

    Returns (successful_count, failed_count, failed_accessions, download_results, abort_reason).
    ``abort_reason`` is ``"disk-full"`` when either pass hit a disk-full error (see
    ``_execute_parallel_downloads`` and ``_retry_failed_downloads``), else ``None``; after a
    first-pass abort no retry pass runs.
