"""The per-run summary of a ``download_sra`` run: the report CSV and ``<fastq>/download_run.json``.

``RunOutcomes`` wraps the run's result callback and keeps, per accession, the last outcome and
the number of attempts that started a download. From those (or from ``download_sra``'s
statistics when the run returned them) ``report_rows`` builds the rows of the ``--report-file``
CSV and ``run_document`` the JSON document written to the FASTQ folder after every run that is
not a dry run, an interrupted one included.

Each failed accession gets one of ``REASONS``. ``failure_reason`` checks the messages the
download layer writes itself (an interruption, a free-space refusal, a lock) before falling back
to ``classify_download_error``, which is left unchanged. A store copy kept but not linked
(``SETTLED_PREFIXES``) is a settled outcome rather than an error with a cause of its own, so it
is ``"unknown"`` whatever words its message contains.
