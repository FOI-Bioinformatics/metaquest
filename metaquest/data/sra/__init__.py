"""
SRA data handling for MetaQuest.

This package downloads SRA accessions and checks the FASTQ files they produce. It is split by
concern:

- ``fastq``: finding, counting, compressing and verifying FASTQ files already on disk
- ``spots``: an accession's expected spot count and the completeness verdict a read count gives
- ``sampling``: drawing a uniform sample of records from a dataset's FASTQ files
- ``cleanup``: recognising, sizing, preparing and removing temporary download folders
- ``accession``: downloading one accession with prefetch and fasterq-dump
- ``store_handoff``: routing a download through the shared data store
- ``retry``: running many downloads in parallel and retrying the failures
- ``download``: ``download_sra``, the entry point for a whole accession list
- ``run_report``: a run's failure reasons and attempt counts, its report CSV and ``download_run.json``
  (imported from the submodule, not re-exported here)

The public names other packages import are re-exported here. Private names are imported from
their submodule, and each submodule refers to a sibling's names through the sibling module
(``accession_mod.download_accession``), so a test patches a name on the module that owns it.
