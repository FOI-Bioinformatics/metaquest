    The store holds one copy of every dataset; the project only ever gets a link to it. A
    copy that is already there is linked without touching the network. Otherwise the store's
    per-accession lock is taken, the sidecar is checked again (another project may have
    finished the download while this one waited), and the download runs into the store.

    The lock is held for the whole download (``metaquest.store.locks.dataset_lock``, which
    heartbeats while held), so a second project waits rather than writing the same folder.
    ``lock_wait`` of zero waits for as long as the other project keeps working; a positive
    value gives up after that many seconds, naming the accession and the holder. ``stop`` is
    the run's stop token: when it (or the process-wide ``STOP``) is set, a wait for the lock
    ends with ``(False, "interrupted")``; it is passed on to ``download_accession``. A lock
    lost while the download ran (``verify_held`` just before the publish) ends with
    ``(False, "lock lost: ...")`` and nothing published.
