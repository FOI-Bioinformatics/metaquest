"""Reconcile the project registry with the disk in two steps: a slow scan, then a fast apply.

``status --reconcile`` walks the FASTQ and targeted folders, counts the reads of every
extraction the registry does not know about and recomputes download completeness verdicts
from the reads on disk. On a large project that takes minutes, far longer than any other
writer should wait for the registry lock. ``scan_reconcile`` therefore does all of that
reading on a snapshot of the registry, without the lock, and returns a ``ReconcilePlan``;
``apply_reconcile`` then applies the plan to the registry loaded inside the lock, checking
each condition again against that registry, and reads no reads. ``reconcile`` runs both
steps on one registry and keeps the behaviour it had before the split.

Before the verdicts, a metadata block recorded without a spot count is filled in from the
project's ``<accession>_metadata.xml`` file, when there is one. A download whose verdict is
missing or ``unverified`` is then checked again once a spot count is known: a plain project
download by counting its mate-1 file and its file of unpaired spots, a link into the shared
store by comparing the read count the store's sidecar records, without reading any FASTQ.
A download whose spot count is still unknown keeps its ``unverified`` verdict. The first
reconcile after upgrading therefore reads the mate-1 file (and any file of unpaired spots)
of every ``unverified`` plain download that has a spot count, which on a large project takes
about as long as reading those files once; later runs find those verdicts known and read
nothing again.

A link into a store that is not mounted (the link's target and its ``sra`` folder are both
absent) is reported in ``StoreReconcileReport.store_unavailable`` and its download is not
marked missing; a dangling link into a mounted store, whose dataset folder is gone, is.

The module sits next to ``metaquest.data.registry``, which is held at its current size by
the module size ceiling; that module re-exports ``reconcile``.
