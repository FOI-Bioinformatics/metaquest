"""Cross-stage funnel counts for `status`: how far a project's datasets got through the pipeline.

`funnel` reduces a registry to one dict per pipeline stage (screened, selected, downloaded,
analysed, extracted, assembled), each holding at least an ``accessions`` count that matches
`metaquest.data.registry.stage_members`; the download, extraction and assembly stages also carry
bytes, seconds and/or pairs read from the registry's raw blocks in the same pass.
`metaquest.cli.commands.status.render_text` renders the result as one text line, and the 0.9.0
`project_report` command reads it to build the project-level report.

    ``members`` is ``stage_members(registry)`` when the caller already built it (``status``
    reuses the one it built for the report's ``stages`` block); every ``accessions`` count below
    is ``len(members[stage])``, so the funnel's counts never drift from ``status``'s own stage
    counts. One further pass over ``registry.datasets`` reads the rest, straight from each
    dataset's raw ``download``/``extractions`` dict rather than building a typed block per
    dataset:

    - ``downloaded``: ``bytes`` sums ``bytes_total`` over the datasets in the "downloaded"
      stage (a download that is not in that state never has files on record, so its
      ``bytes_total`` is always 0); ``seconds`` sums the recorded download time of the same
      datasets, so all three figures describe one set; ``failed`` counts datasets whose download
      state is "failed" and ``failed_seconds`` sums their recorded time (the other state a
      download's ``seconds`` is recorded for, see
      ``metaquest.data.registry_timing.TIMED_DOWNLOAD_STATES``).
    - ``extracted``/``assembled``: ``pairs`` counts the (accession, genome) extractions and
      assemblies that meet the same mapped-reads/contigs threshold
      ``metaquest.data.registry._extraction_stage`` uses to decide stage membership (one
      accession can hold more than one such pair, so ``pairs`` can exceed ``accessions``);
      ``seconds`` and (for assemblies) ``total_bp`` are summed over that same set of pairs, not
      every recorded extraction/assembly attempt, so an extraction with zero mapped reads (or an
      assembly with zero contigs) contributes to neither.

    A stage's ``seconds`` is None, not 0, when nothing in it was ever timed.
