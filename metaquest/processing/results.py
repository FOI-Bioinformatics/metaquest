"""The consolidated results table: one row per screened (accession, genome) pair.

Joins what the project registry records for each pair (screening, selection, exclusion,
download, run metadata, the dataset quality summary of ``sra_profile``/``sra_report``, read
extraction, reference coverage and assembly) with the containment values of the parsed
containment table, which are unrounded and not limited by ``cap_screening``. Three columns
before the end are the seconds the download, the extraction and the assembly took, when the
registry records them; ``download_verdict`` is the accession's recorded download completeness
verdict (``complete``, ``truncated`` or ``unverified``), empty when none was recorded.

The last eight columns were added after ``download_verdict`` and are empty wherever the
registry has nothing to report: ``quality_source`` names which analysis supplied the
``total_reads``/``gc_percent``/``quality_grade`` columns (``profile``, ``report``, ``legacy``,
or empty when neither ran); ``assembly_largest``, ``assembly_n90``, ``assembly_gc_percent``
(the assembly's GC fraction as a percent, two decimals) and ``assembly_contigs_ge_1kb`` are
extra contig statistics beyond ``contigs``/``total_bp``/``n50``, empty without an assembly;
``assembly_mean_depth_estimate`` is empty unless the assembly's coverage mapping was run;
``assembly_dir`` and ``coverage_tsv`` are the assembly folder and the coverage table's path,
each relative to the project root (the registry file's folder) like every other path column.
