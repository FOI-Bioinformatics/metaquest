Optional dependencies, imported only when a command needs them.

The core install (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, biopython, lxml, requests) is enough to load the
CLI and run the download and containment steps. Packages behind an extra are imported at the
point of use through ``require``, which turns a missing package into a ``ConfigurationError``
that names the extra to install and the interpreter to install it into.
