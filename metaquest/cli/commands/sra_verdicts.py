"""The registry inputs and completeness verdicts ``download_sra``, ``store_link`` and ``store_adopt`` record.

``registry_inputs`` collects what the download loop needs from the project registry, with each
accession's expected spot count looked up in the order ``metaquest.data.sra.spots.expected_spots``
documents: the registry's metadata, the store sidecar (for a run with a store), the metadata XML
(the project's metadata folder, then the store's) and last the count of the verdict on file.
``present_verdicts`` verifies an accession that is on disk without a ``downloaded`` record, as a run
killed after its files were in place leaves it; it reads FASTQ files, so it runs before the
registry lock is taken. ``recorded_verdict`` is the verdict to record, under the lock, for a
download, a present accession or a dataset linked from the shared store: recomputed when a read
count and a spot count are both known, and never an ``unverified`` one in place of a recorded
``complete`` or ``truncated`` one.

For a store accession the one rule is ``store_verdict``: the sidecar's verdict (read before the lock
is taken) judged against the project's spot count (``store_spot_count``, also read before the lock)
and merged with the verdict on file. ``download_sra`` (a link, or a settled ``incomplete:`` result),
``store_link`` and ``store_adopt`` all record it, so a relink never turns ``truncated`` into
``unverified``.
