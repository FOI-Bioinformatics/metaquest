    """Command to report, and optionally remove, unused datasets and leftover temp files.

    A dataset is a removal candidate when it has no usage rows at all and no live project
    symlinks it. Three things keep a dataset out of the candidate list and into the report's
    ``still_linked``, ``in_use`` and ``kept_stale`` sections: a live project's symlink, a held
    accession lock (another run is downloading or adopting it right now), and usage rows that
    belong only to projects ``stale_projects`` (see ``metaquest.store.usage``) cannot see from
    this machine, which on a shared store is every project on another workstation. That last
    case needs ``--include-stale`` before it is removed. Placeholder rows (``state="unknown"``,
    a usage row recorded ahead of its dataset) stand for no files and are never candidates.

    Leftover temp artifacts (``<store>/tmp/*_temp`` from an interrupted download,
    ``<store>/tmp/*_adopt`` from an interrupted adopt, ``<store>/tmp/*_old`` from a publish,
    ``<store>/tmp/*_gc`` from an interrupted removal by this command, a bare ``<store>/tmp/<ACC>``
    from a killed download's staging folder, the ``.sra-cache`` archive cache under ``tmp`` or
    ``sra``) are reported and removed independently of the dataset check, minus anything whose
    accession lock is held. Nothing is removed unless ``--yes`` is given; the default is a
    dry-run report only.

    With ``--yes``, a candidate is removed only under its own accession lock, taken without
    waiting, and only once a fresh re-check right before removal still agrees with the
    classification above; either the lock being held by then or that re-check failing (another
    run started using it, or ``metaquest.store.locks.touch_dataset_use`` recorded it within
    the grace period) adds the accession to ``in_use`` instead, alongside one already found
    there during classification (see ``_still_removable``).
