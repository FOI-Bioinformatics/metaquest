"""
Shared data store CLI commands.

`store_init` creates (or reuses) a shared data store folder and records it, along with this
project's identity, in the project registry. `store_status` and `store_reindex` operate
against whichever store root resolves for the current project (an explicit `--data-root`, the
`METAQUEST_DATA` environment variable, the registry's recorded `store.root`, or the user's
default config), via `metaquest.store.resolve.resolve_store_root`.

Every command here exists to operate on the store, so an unreachable one is an error with
exit 1, not something to work around; the analysis and reporting commands degrade instead
(see `metaquest.store.resolve.resolve_optional_store`). A project that links from the store
without ever running `store_init` has its identity minted on the spot
(`metaquest.store.usage.ensure_project_identity`), so `store_gc` can always see who uses what.

Each command lives in its own module; helpers used by more than one live in `_shared`.
