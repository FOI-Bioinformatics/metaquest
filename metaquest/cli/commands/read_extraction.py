        spent on it, a module held at a frozen line ceiling, so it is measured from this side.
        The first sample also includes reading the containment table and selecting the samples,
        and the first that needs mapping the building of the minimap2 index.

        Checked here -- the boundary between one sample finishing and the next starting --
        rather than inside ``extract_target_reads``'s loop, a module held at a frozen line
        ceiling. Raising ``KeyboardInterrupt`` from an ``on_result`` callback is not swallowed
        by its caller (``_notify_result`` only catches ``Exception``), so it reaches ``execute``
        and then ``BaseCommand.run``, which logs, stops any running tool and returns 130. The
        sample just checkpointed above is recorded either way; the next one in
        ``extract_target_reads``'s ``samples`` list is never started.
