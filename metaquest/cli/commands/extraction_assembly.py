"""The assembly step of ``extract_target_reads --assemble``.

Each sample with extracted reads is assembled while its extraction lock is held, so a sample
being extracted or assembled by another process is skipped rather than assembled twice. An
existing assembly is kept only when its identity marker (``data/assembly_identity.py``) matches
the reads and settings of this run; an assembly built from other reads or settings, or a folder
an interrupted megahit left without contigs, is assembled again. A sample whose assembly fails is
reported and the remaining samples are still assembled.
