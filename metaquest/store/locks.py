"""
The per-accession lock that guards one dataset's folder in the shared store.

A store download or adoption owns ``<store>/sra/<ACC>`` for as long as the transfer takes,
which for a large run is minutes to hours. The lock is ``<store>/locks/<ACC>.lock``, taken
through ``metaquest.utils.lockfile.held_lock``: the holder's heartbeat refreshes the file's
mtime every ``LOCK_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS``, so a waiter waits for as long as the holder stays
alive, with no overall timeout (giving up on a legitimate multi-hour download would be the
bug, not the wait). A lock whose heartbeat stopped more than ``DATASET_LOCK_STALE_SECONDS``
ago, or whose holder is known to have exited on this host, is taken over with a warning. A
caller that would rather not wait passes ``wait_seconds``; the resulting error names the
accession and the holder. A caller that would rather skip a held lock than wait for it at
all (``store_gc`` and ``store_verify``, which touch the store opportunistically rather than
as a project's main job) passes ``blocking=False``, which raises ``LockHeld`` at once.

``touch_dataset_use``/``last_dataset_use`` are a second, unrelated marker under the same
``<store>/locks/`` folder, ``<ACC>.used``: its mtime records when a project last started
using the dataset (a link, an adopt), independent of whether the accession's own lock is
held right now. ``store_gc`` keeps a dataset touched within ``GC_RECENT_USE_GRACE_SECONDS``
even when nothing currently holds its lock and its catalogue usage row has not caught up yet.

The limits are read from this module at call time, so tests can shrink them.
