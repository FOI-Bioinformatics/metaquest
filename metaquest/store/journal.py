"""Append-only journal of the store's project and usage records.

The SQLite catalogue is the working copy of "which project used which dataset", but it is the
only copy: sidecars know nothing about projects. ``store_reindex`` rebuilds the catalogue from
sidecars and would otherwise come back with no projects and no usage, after which ``store_gc``
sees every dataset as unused. Every ``upsert_project`` and ``record_usage`` therefore also
appends one JSON line here, and ``replay`` feeds those lines back into a rebuilt catalogue.
Appends happen inside ``catalog_write``, which holds the store-wide write lock.
