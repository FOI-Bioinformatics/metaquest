"""
SQLite catalogue over the shared data store: ``<root>/catalog.sqlite``.

The catalogue is a rebuildable index over every sidecar in the store, plus two
cross-project tables (``projects`` and ``usage``) that record which project used
which dataset, for which target genome, at which pipeline stage. It answers
questions no single sidecar or project registry can: which projects used one
accession, which downloaded datasets no project references any more, how many
bytes are held per target genome, and which datasets were analysed for one
genome across every project. Because it is rebuildable from the sidecars
(``reindex``), losing or corrupting ``catalog.sqlite`` never loses data; it
only loses the cross-project ``usage`` history, which lives only here.

Writes are serialised across processes with the same lock protocol the
per-project registry uses (``metaquest.data.registry._acquire_lock``), on a
``catalog.sqlite.lock`` file next to the database, so two projects on one
machine or a shared network volume never interleave writes. Reads may open the
database directly without taking the lock.
