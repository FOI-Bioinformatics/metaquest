The link a project keeps into the shared store.

One dataset is downloaded once, into ``<store>/sra/<ACC>/``. Every project
that uses it gets ``<project>/fastq/<ACC>`` as a symlink to that folder, so
the rest of MetaQuest reads the project path exactly as if the reads were
local. This module creates, removes and recognises those links, and reports
links whose target has gone away.
