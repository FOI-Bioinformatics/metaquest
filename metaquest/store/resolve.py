Store root discovery and the small user config file that can name one.

The shared data store is one folder holding a single copy of every
downloaded metagenome, used across organism projects. Its root is found, in
order, from: an explicit flag, the METAQUEST_DATA environment variable, a
project registry's recorded root, or the user config file. This module
resolves that precedence and reads/writes the user config.
