"""One retrying HTTP session builder, shared by every client that calls an external API.

NCBI, GTDB and Branchwater are all flaky in the same way: an occasional connection failure, a 429
(rate limited) or a 5xx while the service recovers. ``retrying_session`` mounts one urllib3
``Retry`` policy on both ``http://`` and ``https://`` so a caller's ``session.get(...)`` retries
those failures with backoff automatically, without each client re-implementing the same few lines
of ``requests.adapters``/``urllib3.util.retry`` wiring. ``raise_on_status=False`` means a session
built this way never raises urllib3's own ``MaxRetryError`` when every retry is exhausted; the
last response is returned instead, so the caller's own ``response.raise_for_status()`` reports the
plain HTTP error it would have reported without retries at all.
