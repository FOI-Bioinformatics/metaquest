"""Graceful handling of SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP for the length of a command.

A batch job's time limit, ``kill``, a closed terminal or Ctrl-C would otherwise end the process
at an arbitrary point, or end it again while it is writing what it has done so far.
``graceful_termination`` turns the first of these signals into ``KeyboardInterrupt``, so
``finally`` blocks and ``with`` exits run (a registry batch is flushed, running tools are
stopped). A later signal is logged and counted but not raised, so it cannot cut the final
write short. After ``abandon_after`` signals in total the process stops waiting: running tools
are killed and the process exits with code 130 at once. That is safe for the lock files, whose
holders are recognised as dead by their heartbeat and process id, and for the registry and
store files, which are only ever replaced whole.
