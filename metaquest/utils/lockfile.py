"""
One lock-file mechanism for every lock MetaQuest takes.

A lock is a file created with ``O_EXCL``, which works on local disks, exFAT, NFS and SMB
alike. The file holds a JSON holder record ``{pid, host, started, token, pidns}``: ``token``
is a random value that identifies this one acquisition, and ``pidns`` (Linux only) is the
inode of the holder's pid namespace, so a pid is only interpreted inside the namespace it
belongs to. Each lock is taken under a ``LockPolicy`` that names what it protects and sets
its stale threshold, wait limit, poll interval and heartbeat interval.

While a lock is held, one daemon thread per process refreshes the file's mtime every
``heartbeat_seconds``, so the file's age measures how long ago the holder was last alive,
not how long it has been working. A waiter removes a lock only when that age exceeds
``stale_seconds`` or when the holder is known to be dead (same host, same pid namespace,
and no process with its pid). The removal happens under a second ``O_EXCL`` file,
``<lock>.reclaim``, and only if the lock file is still the one the waiter judged, so two
waiters can never both remove a lock and one of them remove the other's new lock: the lock
is moved aside with ``rename`` and compared again before it is discarded.

Release compares the token under the same guard and never removes a lock that now belongs to
someone else. The heartbeat reads the token and touches the file through one descriptor. A
holder record that is not JSON (a bare pid written by an older version, or a test fixture)
is never judged dead; it follows the age rule alone.

On the main thread, SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP are blocked (``pthread_sigmask``) from just
before a lock file is created until the acquisition is recorded as held, so a first signal
cannot leave a lock file that nothing releases; a signal arriving meanwhile is delivered as
soon as the lock is recorded. Windows and threads other than the main one get no mask; the
heartbeat thread blocks these signals for good. Remaining windows, all rare and all ending in
a wait rather than in lost data: a signal the kernel delivers to another thread of the
process (a download worker) while the main thread is in that section still reaches Python
there; a ``KeyboardInterrupt`` raised while a release waits for the reclaim guard
(``_wait_for_guard``) leaves the lock file in place until it goes stale; and a process
killed (SIGKILL) while it holds a reclaim guard leaves the guard, so for
``RECLAIM_GUARD_STALE_SECONDS`` every release of that lock waits
``RELEASE_GUARD_WAIT_SECONDS`` and no waiter can reclaim it.
