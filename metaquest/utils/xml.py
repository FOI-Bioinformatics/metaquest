"""The one lxml parser every MetaQuest module reads an XML file with, and the function that uses it.

NCBI and store metadata files are mostly trusted, but they can be cached, replayed from a shared
store, or (for a store shared between projects) written by another process on the same host, so a
parser that would expand an entity or follow a DTD reference is a foothold for two well known XML
attacks: XXE (an external entity that reads a local file or calls out over the network) and
billion laughs (an internal entity that expands into gigabytes of text from a few bytes of
markup). ``SAFE_PARSER`` turns every one of those features off. The stdlib ``xml.etree`` call
sites elsewhere in MetaQuest (``data/metadata.py``, ``data/sra_metadata.py``, ``data/taxonomy.py``)
are not moved onto this module: CPython's expat binding has refused entity expansion by default
since Python 3.7.1 (a fix for CVE-2013-1753 plus later hardening), so the billion-laughs and XXE
risk this module guards against does not apply to them the way it applies to lxml's very
permissive defaults.

# never read) and leaves a "billion laughs" document's entities unexpanded too, though libxml2's
# own entity-amplification limit (on regardless of these flags) is what actually raises on one
# nested deeply enough to matter. no_network=True refuses a DTD or entity fetched over the
# network even if resolve_entities were turned back on for one caller. load_dtd=False refuses an
# _external_ DTD or external parameter entity (a document's inline internal subset, the
# `<!DOCTYPE ... [ ... ]>` block, is still read to learn what entities exist; resolve_entities is
# what keeps their use inert). huge_tree=False (lxml's own default; named here for clarity rather
# than to change it) keeps libxml2's guards against a single grossly oversized document.
