"""
Progress summaries for long runs over many items.

A run over thousands of accessions that logged one INFO line per item would bury its warnings;
``ProgressReporter`` logs one summary line every ``every`` items, or every ``min_interval``
seconds when items are slow, and one line when the run finishes::

    download_sra: 150/2000 done (148 ok, 2 failed), 3.1/min, about 9 h 57 min left
    download_sra: finished 2000/2000 (1990 ok, 10 failed) in 10 h 45 min

The caller logs its own line per item at ``item_level``: DEBUG while summaries are on, INFO when
``every`` is 0, which turns the summaries off and restores one INFO line per item.
